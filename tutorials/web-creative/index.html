    In a world where everything is run by AI people there's a routine set in place. Everyone wakes up at 7am, takes their coffee and gets ready for work. Kids get their cereal and get ready for their classes as they as well have a long day for them. Books are replaced with tablets, and their puzzles are replaced with 3d projection models.
	The air quality is cleaner and the food is healthier. Everyone is fit and doesn't struggle with any sort of disease.  </p>

        Where did diseases go ? 

        How is everything so perfect ?

        Peaceful ?</p>

     Questions one might ask but if you don’t know what life was like before how would you ever know?
    It's almost like everyone got brainwashed or their memory erased, I try to remember but it all feels like a blur. I try to talk to my mom about it but she seems confused, I feel like the memories I keep seeing aren't mine. I tried talking to my Model Tony about it but he just said that I am dreaming. I asked him “So day dreaming as well?”

    Tony is trained by the higher up committee. The committee are the only humans who have power; there are five of them. Most of them I believe are born into them and only two of them studied hard to get into their positions. I heard you have to be able to beat the most advanced AI Model Kate, in a game of Chess to get considered for the position.

    The committee monitors all AI models who are out to the public to follow their policies if any model acts or says anything out of the ordinary they are taken in for repairs or deconstructed to get remodeled into a different model.

    There was once a whole line of models I can’t really talk about but they were called the MAX.
    They started off fine but over time they were not following regulation and slowly became like an over protective parent. My parents got me one when I was 2 and I guess MAX wouldn't let me crawl or walk. I guess he would always just carry me and I would always cry. It happened to many parents and kids where there was a tweak in the babysitting code.

    After that the regulations got stricter on AI models but do you think it ended there?. I believe they are watching us through these AI models but I think they are just making sure we are okay. Tonys are supposed to honor civilians who serve the community. There was a story recently where a tony saved a kid from getting hit by a car where the driver wasn’t pay attention and the kid ran into the street. Therefore any retaliation of the AI models gets shut down quickly.

    A few years back there was a group of people against these robots living in homes and watching over us and the next day we don’t know where these people went. The whole world lives under this committee and there is no one who can voice their opinion on this topic. Though I do think its crazy we lal have out lifes all planned out before we are even born. But who am I to complain when I genuinely love my life here.

    I don’t understand why a person who could go against these robots would help us so much. I enjoy being able to talk to Ton and he helps me so much. Once I couldn't figure out an equation  for class and it was 1 am in the night  and he showed me and explained to me how to do it. I don’t see the issue especially when I basically have an at home tutor. There was one time where he needed an update and we told him to take out the dishes and he broke a few but after the update he was okay. It's almost like he was sick or something. My parents were mad but it is okay now we just ended up replacing the dishes.

  Overall, I think my life is pretty cool. I do say sometimes I do think these dreams have more meaning, but I try not to think about it too much. Lately, though, the dreams have felt more vivid, almost real like glimpses into a  world that I don't know. Either way, I wake up feeling anxious like my reality isn’t real. It's okay though, anyways I have to go. I'll talk to you later.
