    In a world where everything is run by AI people there's a routine set in place. Everyone wakes up at 7am, takes their coffee and gets ready for work. Kids get their cereal and get ready for their classes as they as well have a long day for them. Books are replaced with tablets, and their puzzles are replaced with 3d projection models.
	The air quality is cleaner and the food is healthier. Everyone is fit and doesn't struggle with any sort of disease.  </p>

        Where did diseases go ? 

        How is everything so perfect ?

        Peaceful ?</p>

     Questions one might ask but if you don’t know what life was like before how would you ever know?
    It's almost like everyone got brainwashed or their memory erased, I try to remember but it all feels like a blur. I try to talk to my mom about it but she seems confused, I feel like the memories I keep seeing aren't mine. I tried talking to my Model Tony about it but he just said that I am dreaming. I asked him “So day dreaming as well?”

    Tony is trained by the higher up committee. The committee are the only humans who have power; there are five of them. Most of them I believe are born into them and only two of them studied hard to get into their positions. I heard you have to be able to beat the most advanced AI Model Kate, in a game of Chess to get considered for the position.

    The committee monitors all AI models who are out to the public to follow their policies if any model acts or says anything out of the ordinary they are taken in for repairs or deconstructed to get remodeled into a different model.

    There was once a whole line of models I can’t really talk about but they were called the MAX.
    They started off fine but over time they were not following regulation and slowly became like an over protective parent. My parents got me one when I was 2 and I guess MAX wouldn't let me crawl or walk. I guess he would always just carry me and I would always cry. It happened to many parents and kids where there was a tweak in the babysitting code.

    Overall I think my life is pretty cool. I do say the nightmares I have have been getting to real hopefully when I go to the doctors I can get some sleep medications. Anyways I’ll talk to you later !
